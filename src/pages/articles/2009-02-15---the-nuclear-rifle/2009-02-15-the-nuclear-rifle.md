I was happily perusing a [gallery of cold war dooms day weapons](http://www.photographyserved.com/Gallery/Weapons-of-Mass-Destruction/56260) as one does when I noticed something called the [M65 Atomic Cannon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M65_Atomic_Cannon). Having done a bit of googling I have discovered that not only is this a mobile cannon which fires NUCLEAR FREAKING WARHEADS, but there is also a [shoulder mounted variant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M65_recoiless_nuclear_rifle). 

I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking of nuclear weapons as the stealth bomber carried final move the in the game of [Mutually Assured Destruction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction) which is scary enough, but this is something else again.

The idea of soldiers wandering about the battlefield with atomic rifles shows just how insane the cold war would have been had it become hot.

This rather terrifying video shows it in action.
