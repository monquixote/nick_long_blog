For those of you who fancy a go with Ubuntu, but don't want all the bother of having to install all the extra codecs and bits of useful software that can't be distributed with the main build then [Super Ubuntu might be the thing for you](http://lifehacker.com/5123360/super-ubuntu-rolls-multimedia-and-helpful-extras-into-ubuntu) wrapping it all up into one handy distro.
