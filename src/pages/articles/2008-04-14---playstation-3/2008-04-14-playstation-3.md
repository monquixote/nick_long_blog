So I'm taking the plunge on my next geek venture and grabbing myself a PS3 this afternoon.  
For those of you who know what a hardcore Nintendophile I am you maybe a little bit confused about this so allow me to enlighten you.  
I've had a rather nifty HD LCD for about a year and a sad lack of HD content to watch on it and it occurred to me that if someone had been offering a Linux media centre that output 1080p played Blu Ray movies and had 6 (count em) 3Ghz processors for Â£300 quid I would have bitten their hand off.  
Such a beast is a PS3. Having done a bit of digging it turns out that not only can you run Linux on PS3 it is officially supported by Sony and you can boot in and out of Linux from a menu option in the PS3 native OS. The other rather nifty fact is that the PS3 uses a standard SATA laptop hard drive which can be fairly easily replaced by the user to give it some serious media centre drive space.  
Under normal circumstances I would baulk at the high price of the films and games, but luckily I have a Love Film subscription which means I can hire them out at will for no more than the cost of a regular DVD.  
Anyone else out there in blog land got a PS3?  
The deal I'm getting comes with Burnout, GT5 and Army of Two so if anyone fancys some multiplayer goodness let me know.

Finally apologies for those that read my blog as I've been really busy lately and haven't had the chance to update. Hopefully I'll get back to some semblance of regularity over the coming weeks.
