At last a new rave album that actually is ravey (rather than just indie with keyboards and glowsticks).  
Some good scratchy bleepy noises perfect for us venerable pop music pensioners who enjoyed acid house the first time around.  
Like all good dance music the album is named after some knobs that can be found on a synthesizer.  
I was a bit sceptical when I downloaded this that it was going to be all hype and no content as the group are flavour of the month due to their association with The Arctic Monkeys (remember Dustins Bar Mitzvahâ€¦ ergh) , but I was very pleasantly surprised.  
It's available on e-music so if you have an account get and download it, and if you don't then get an e-music account then download it!
