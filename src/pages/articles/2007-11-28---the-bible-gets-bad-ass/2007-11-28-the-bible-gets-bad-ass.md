[This Article](http://www.cracked.com/article_15699_9-most-badass-bible-verses.html) had me laughing so much the missus just came in to ask me what I was up to.

The bible has some really bizarre stuff in it for example:

_“And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them” (2 Kgs. 2:23-24).&#8221;_

but it's the commentary that makes it ultra funny.
