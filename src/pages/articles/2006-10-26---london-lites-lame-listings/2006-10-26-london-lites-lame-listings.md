I was reading the listings in the [London Lite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Lite) on the tube on the way home last night (A London Free Paper mostly concerned with celeb gossip) and noticed some truely lazy music journalism.
[Ray Lamontagne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Lamontagne) whose single Trouble echoes [Nick Drakes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Drake) softly spoken style

Say what?

Last time I listened to Trouble the guy sounded like a love weary <span>Grizzly</span> Adams bellowing an Otis Reading song, with a gob full of gravel. Drake on the other hand sounds like a painfully shy posh boy singing rather <span>eloquently</span> in a very English accent.  
I think what they actually meant was:  
__  
I don't really know anything about Ray <span>Lamontagne</span> other than the fact that he doesn't do interviews and he is very shy and the most famous singer/songwriter I can think of who was also quite shy is Nick Drake&#8221;_

Tomorrow I'm expecting <span>something</span> along the lines of:  
_&#8220;If you enjoyed the Streets latest record why not listen to <span>UB</span>40 who are also from Birmingham&#8221;_

Still what did I expect for free&#8230;.
