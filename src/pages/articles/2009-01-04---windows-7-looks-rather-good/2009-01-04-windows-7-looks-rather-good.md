After the numerous Vista bashing and pro Linux posts you will have seen me make you would be forgiven for thinking I was a raging MS hater, not so.

I've been reading up on Windows 7 and so far I'm quite impressed.  
OS news have posted an interesting review  <a href="http://osnews.com/story/20722/Review_Windows_7_Beta/page3/" target="_new">here </a> and the  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2008/11/20/happy-anniversary-windows-on-the-evolution-of-the-taskbar.aspx" target="_new">Microsoft Engineering Windows 7 blog </a> has a really great article about the sensible sounding changes they have made to the taskbar.

Couple that with <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/01/03/234242" target="_new">some rather promising looking benchmark results </a>and I could even be persuaded to give it a try (Once SP1 comes out that is).
