The excellent book Ubuntu Pocket Guide and Reference by Keir Thomas is available for free download from this link: http://www.ubuntupocketguide.com/aboutthebook.html

It's probably a little basic for a hardcore Nix head but if you are considering breathing new life into an old laptop or ditching Vista then I'm sure it will be a lot of help.
