First up [Happy St Skeletors day](http://mat.tl/skeletor/2008/about/) alll you love haters out there.

EEE User have a link to a [guy at laptop magazine who is trying to use an EEE as his only PC](http://www.eeeuser.com/2008/02/07/i-gave-up-my-notebook-for-an-eee-pc-parts-1-3/).  
If you get external storage and a monitor I think it could make a great budget PC for people who just want to browse and work especially with Xubuntu installed.

Neetorama have a cool article with [facts about Edison](http://www.neatorama.com/2008/02/11/10-fascinating-facts-about-edison/) admittedly I am what my sister calls a &#8220;fact head&#8221;, but I thought it was worth reading.

Some jerk has hassled You Tube into dropping the awesome guitar parody videos that showed up a while back, but Wired have rather excellently hosted them all and you can see them [here](http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/02/watch-the-parod.html#more) I think Santana is my fav.

This [colour tile illusion from Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/02/08/color-tile-optical-i.html) really freaks me out. I love optical illusions and all that jazz.
