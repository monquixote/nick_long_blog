description: "In which I help Michal Buerk send a fax"
---
Every so often [Michael Buerk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Buerk) wanders into my office and asks if he can borrow my Fax machine (I've no idea why he does this).  
The only problem is that despite the fact that I sit next to the huge beige monstrosity and I am employed as a technologist I have no idea how it actually works.  

The ubiquity of e-mail means that I've only had to use a fax machine about 3 times in my life (and always at the behest of an estate agent) and though most are fairly self explanatory ours is a monster (It even has a [Mercury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Communications) button). 
It has a help button that when you press it displays a message in its tiny screen "Press any button for help on that feature" and then when you press the button for example "Confirm" it prints out a sheet of paper with "Help Index #88934 CONFIRM BUTTON -: PRESS TO CONFIRM ACTIONS" written in tiny letters at one corner.  

The net result is that I fiddle arround trying to help him with an array of buttons that all go bleep and do nothing whilst the 999 music plays in my head and I think "Little did they know that playing with the fax machine would prove deadly!"

I can't work photocopiers either...
