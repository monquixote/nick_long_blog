A petition has sprung up on [the 10 Downing street site](http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page1.asp) asking for mandatory notification if a company looses your personal data.  
I think this is an excellent idea. There is nothing better than the threat of bad publicity to keep people honest.  
As it stands if a company accidentally spill your data to a bunch of credit scammers their best course of action is just to hush it up.
