[What was thought to be interference in a German gravitational wave detector could turn out to be proof that reality is in some sense a hologram.](http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126911.300-our-world-may-be-a-giant-hologram.html?page=1)   
While this is a fascinating discovery in its self it is a perfect example of one the things that makes me love science (<span>Yes</span>, I love science).

Every so often in the world of physics there is a theorist wondering how to find proof of their new idea while someone performing an experiment designed to measure something completely different sits scratching their heads at a set of results that seem to make no sense. It happened with Einstein predicting the [Brownian Motion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion) that baffled Robert Brown and with the discovery of [cosmic background radiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation) which researchers initially thought was due to their antenna having a fault until they found out about some scientists at Princeton theorising that just such a signal should be found.

So to sum up:
