Well yesterday was a total geek fest so today I'm going to focus on fun stuff:

I've been meaning to share this for ages so it's likely that you may have already seen it, but I love [planethiltron](http://planethiltron.com/) who photoshop celebs back to normality. if all magazines did this we would be rid of eating disorders at a stroke.

This [collection of famous poems reworked as limericks](http://badgods.com/limerickpoems.html) is inspired as I proved when I had a crack at doing some myself and failed miserably.

I've heard plenty of great music mashups in my time, but this f[lash game mash up of Metroid and Megaman](http://sess.net/flash_games.php?proj_id=1296&action=play) is awesome. You get to control Megaman taking on the space pirates on the original Metroid maps. Great stuff!

For those of you interested to know what desktop wallpaper I use on my machine at home you will be excited to know that I have this picture of [Haggar piledriving a shark](http://www.nintendowiifanboy.com/2007/10/18/oh-my-shark/) and yes it does come from a site called gay gamer!

This [collection of HRD photography from Japan](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/01/18/beautiful-high-dynam.html) is hyper real. I Love the way that at first glance it appears to be a painting.

Got some time on your hands?  
Why not fold yourself a [towel monkey.](http://lifehacker.com/354549/how-to-fold-a-towel-monkey)

I haven't got around to downloading this [crazy 2D physics simulation game](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/02/20/phun-a-simulated-phy.html)   
yet, but the demo video looks just great.

Staying on gaming. Nintendo have announced that they will be putting [C64 games on the Wii virtual console](http://www.nintendowiifanboy.com/2008/02/21/commodore-64-games-coming-to-european-vc-later-this-year/). 500 points seems a bit steep though.

Finally this [tiny Korean kid playing Hey Jude](http://www.boingboing.net/2008/02/22/adorable-moppet-sing.html) cracks me up.
