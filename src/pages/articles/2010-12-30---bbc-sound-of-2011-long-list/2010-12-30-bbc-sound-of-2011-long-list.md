    The BBC have just published their <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/soundof/2011/">sound of 2011 long list</a> some thoughts as I listen.
  </p>
  
  <div>
    I'm impressed by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/soundof/2011/artists/esbenandthewitch/">Esben and the Witch</a> as their name implies they sound like a dark fairytale. If their album keeps up this level of quality I can see it being on heavy rotation.
  </div>

    I'm a sucker for anything with a Dub Step flavour so I enjoyed <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/soundof/2011/artists/jamiewoon/">Jamie Woon</a> though his voice is a little commercial for my tastes, in the D&B/Dubstep category <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/soundof/2011/artists/nero/">Nero</a> excites me the most. It would be great to see an artist other than Pendulum getting some viscous breaks in the charts.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/soundof/2011/artists/daley/">Daley</a> is clearly a big talent, not the kind of thing I spend a lot of time listening to, but the world needs an alternative to Jamie T who can sing in tune. 
  </div></p> 
  
  <div>
    <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/soundof/2011/artists/nakedandfamous/">The Naked and Famous</a> are perhaps a little too indebted to MGMT on the evidence of what I've heard, but there's always a place in my heart for sunny pop music. 
  </div></p> 
  
  <div>
    No clips on the BBC site but The Vaccines sound like a strange hybrid of Mumford and Sons and Interpol topped off with the fantastic baritone of Justin Young. I found a clip of them playing on Jools Holland you can check out. I'll eat my hat if these guys don't make it (Which naturally means they are doomed)

  <div>
    <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/soundof/2011/artists/warpaint/">Warpaint</a> are capable of dreamy loveliness, but Undertow sounds a little too much like a rewrite of Polly by Nirvana to my ears.
  </div></p> 
  
  <div>
    While Clare Maguire and Jessie J may well end up being huge they do nothing for me. 
  </div></p> 
  
  <div>
    I think <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/soundof/2011/artists/annacalvi/">Anna Calvi</a> has the potential to produce a world class album. Jezebel is a curiosity, but  <a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/06atUL7RZpSXmF2Kb7Oh7E">Moulinette</a> is a wonderful track.
  </div></p>

    I'm not going to make any predictions of who will be the true breakthrough, but even the beeb picked Little Boots over Lady Gaga.
